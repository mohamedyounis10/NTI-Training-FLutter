# NTI Flutter Training – UI Design Practice

This project is part of a training program provided by the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI) focused on **Flutter development**.  
It contains practical exercises and UI implementations based on professional design references.

## 📚 Description

This repository includes my Flutter training exercises under NTI supervision, where I focused on:

- Practicing UI components in Flutter
- Converting ready-made UI designs into working code
- Understanding layout widgets (Row, Column, Stack, Container, etc.)
- Handling basic form inputs and user interface styling
- Practicing multiple UI layouts through three sections in /lib:
  - `ui_1`
  - `ui_2`
  - `ui_3`
